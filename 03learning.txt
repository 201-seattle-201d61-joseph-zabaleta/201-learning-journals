PRACTICE MORE LOOPS!!!!


### CSS Box Model

Briefly touched the topic of CSS Box model. This is how we can create layouts for our HTML. Each element in html has a "box" around it even if you don't see one. We control these boxes using the below properties

* padding
  - space between the border and the box content
* border
  - space between padding and margin that is at the edge of out content
* margin
  - The space between the border and other elements on the page

### Arrays and LOOPS

## Arrays

Talked about what arrays actually are, a bucket of variables.  A variable that holds multiple values is an array.  Best to store things related to each other.
  - Arrays are index based

We covered how to manipulate an array with four commands
  -push: adds an item to end of the array
  -pop: removes an item from the end

  -shift: removes an item from the front of an array
  -unshift: adds an item to the front of an array

## LOOPS

Loops are used to run code more than once. Three types of loops are for, while, and do while loops.

"Arrays and loops are best buds"


###LAB

Today we added onto our guessing game. Two new questions utilizing loops and a lot of if's and else if's and just pure conditional logic. Put our arrays to the test and it was a lot to take in. Just need more practice to really grasp the idea and power behind arrays and loops.
