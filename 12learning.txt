Canvas --

Using JS to draw 2d 3d vector items onto a set canvas  We are able to draw shapes such as circles triangles and rectangles. Canvas is not very responsive and usually has set height and width attributes.  

ChartJS - 3rd Party Library
 - Used for drawing charts with Canvas

Installation uses CDN , content delivery network. Takes a url instead a file path to script link a js file to your page. 

After working with ChartJS I Love them! They are so much customization its huge, flexible, and has a nice visual to it. I was able to put one table and have two data sets on the page. This is a cool library that I think I first saw in Khan Academy training.
