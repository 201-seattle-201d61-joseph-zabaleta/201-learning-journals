Learning notes 04
20200305

Today we started out with a review of the lab that was super helpful to use another students code and tear it apart in the sense of learning about each element and piece.

-Main point
  Was focused on learning functions and what functions can do how do invoke them. We were able to take our current project of guessing game and condense some code.

- Paired programming
  This is a great technique as it lets you see other peoples point of view. Sometimes other developers have a better or different understanding of how a piece of code works and can explain in terms that you will understand. Working on a project as a team was fun.

-Overall lecture
  Sometimes we get caught in a rabit hole, such as we will spend 15+ minutes talking about the more advanced material that applies but doesnt apply towards our current objectives. Overall the class is going well.
